# sub-translator: a subtitles translator script
Script for translating foreign text files into english

I've made this script to translate the subtitles of a russian MOOC. In XXI, language shouldn't be a barrier to learn.

The current version has an underterminaded limit of characters, but I'll improve it soon, finding some way to bypass the restrictions and make it faster.
